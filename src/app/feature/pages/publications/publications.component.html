            <h6 style="text-align: center">The Significance of Privacy Concerns in Spectrum Sharing: A Study on Geo-location Databases (Under Review)</h6>
            <br>
            <b>Abstract</b>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify">The exponential growth of wireless devices and diverse applications has accentuated the urgent necessity for efficient wireless spectrum utilization. In light of constrained spectral resources, regulatory bodies are exploring advanced communication technologies for intelligent spectrum management. Cognitive radios, integrating spectrum sensing capabilities, emerge as pivotal tools for opportunistically leveraging available spectrum segments. Amidst spectrum scarcity challenges, cognitive radios are poised to revolutionize wireless networks’ future. The fusion of geo-location databases in Cognitive radio networks offers a promising avenue for spectrum sharing while raising significant privacy concerns. Secondary users, through seemingly benign database queries, risk compromising primary users’ privacy by pinpointing their exact locations in specific regions, a vulnerability magnified in military system scenarios. This study introduces particle filter and machine learning methodologies to locate mobile primary users, assessing inference attack accuracy through diverse approaches and comparative analyses. Our results highlight Misclassification Errors’ impurity quality superiority over conventional metrics like Gini and Entropy within the particle filter method. The Misclassification Error Percentage Difference Formula, evaluating impurity quality via arithmetic mean, demonstrates a 1.31% enhancement over Gini and a 7.64% improvement over Entropy. In machine learning, the support vector machine method excels in pinpointing primary users’ locations, surpassing ensemble learning, decision trees, and artificial neural networks. The SVM Percentage Difference Formula for Cross-Validation (CV) loss exhibits a 30.14% improvement over DT, a 37.29% enhancement over EL, and a 43.37% superiority over ANN.    </p>        <br>

            <h6 style="text-align: center">Trust, Satisfaction, Loyalty, and Perceived Value: Unraveling the Banking Industry Dynamics (Under Review)</h6>
            <br>
            <b>Abstract</b>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              This study delves into the impact of perceived value and customer satisfaction on brand loyalty within the context of the Bank Melli of Iran, while also examining the mediating role of brand trust in these relationships. Categorized as applied and survey research, this study focuses on customers frequenting Bank Melli branches in Tehran’s first district. A sample of 385 individuals, selected through the Krejcie and Morgan table, participated in the study. Data collection was conducted using a combination of cluster and non-random sampling methods through questionnaires, with the reliability of the questionnaire assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. The study reveals a significant positive influence of perceived value and customer satisfaction on brand loyalty and brand trust, with brand loyalty reciprocally reinforcing brand trust. This research sheds light on the intricate dynamics between perceived value, customer satisfaction, brand loyalty, and brand trust in the banking industry. It emphasizes the critical role of customer perceptions in brand building and highlights the interconnectedness of these factors in influencing customer relationships and brand reputation.
