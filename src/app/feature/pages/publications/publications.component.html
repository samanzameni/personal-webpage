            <h6 style="text-align: center">The Significance of Privacy Concerns in Spectrum Sharing: A Study on Geo-location Databases (Under Review)</h6>
            <br>
            <b>Abstract</b>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify">The exponential growth of wireless devices and diverse applications has accentuated the urgent necessity for efficient wireless spectrum utilization. In light of constrained spectral resources, regulatory bodies are exploring advanced communication technologies for intelligent spectrum management. Cognitive radios, integrating spectrum sensing capabilities, emerge as pivotal tools for opportunistically leveraging available spectrum segments. Amidst spectrum scarcity challenges, cognitive radios are poised to revolutionize wireless networks’ future. The fusion of geo-location databases in Cognitive radio networks offers a promising avenue for spectrum sharing while raising significant privacy concerns. Secondary users, through seemingly benign database queries, risk compromising primary users’ privacy by pinpointing their exact locations in specific regions, a vulnerability magnified in military system scenarios. This study introduces particle filter and machine learning methodologies to locate mobile primary users, assessing inference attack accuracy through diverse approaches and comparative analyses. Our results highlight Misclassification Errors’ impurity quality superiority over conventional metrics like Gini and Entropy within the particle filter method. The Misclassification Error Percentage Difference Formula, evaluating impurity quality via arithmetic mean, demonstrates a 1.31% enhancement over Gini and a 7.64% improvement over Entropy. In machine learning, the support vector machine method excels in pinpointing primary users’ locations, surpassing ensemble learning, decision trees, and artificial neural networks. The SVM Percentage Difference Formula for Cross-Validation (CV) loss exhibits a 30.14% improvement over DT, a 37.29% enhancement over EL, and a 43.37% superiority over ANN.    </p>        <br>
